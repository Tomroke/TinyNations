# Challenge
1. Make basic units useful in such a way that they contribute to the fight and worth taking.
2. Make it so that having a force of only Elite units has some form of disadvantages.
3. K.I.S.S - Keep it simple stupid. Don't over complicate the rules.
4. How to avoid the dump hand effect.
	- Kind of hindered by Reaction Cards. You want to stop your opponent and your opponent can stop you.


1. **Stamina per unit**
	Each Unit has a Stamina value which decides how expensive and how many cards they can use.
	
	Each card has a Stamina cost.
	
	 Any number of units can be activated. Limiting factor is cards in hand.
	 
	 May need movement cards or add movement to basic card function.
	 
	 Reaction cards would be based on what cards they have left and which units have stamina remaining
	
	- PRO: 
	- CON: Would favour making a deck where you get low cost cards that you can play on high stamina minions

2. **Get X Stamina per turn**
	At the beginning of each turn a player gets X stamina, which they can use to activate units.
	
	Each Unit has a cost which must be paid for it to be activated. Or each unit costs one.
	
	Each activated unit can move and have one card played on it.
	
	- PRO: Removes the need for stamina on cards, eliminating a balancing factor.
	- CON: 
		- Would heavily favour elite and general units if Activation cost was 1.
		- Would favour basic units if their cost is low enough.

3. **Chess**
	One unit per turn, can move and play a card.
	
	One reaction from opponent.
	
	- PRO: No math, simple, basic straight forward
	- CON: Very limited in the tactics department

4. **Command Point & Stamina**
	 Get X CP per turn to activate units.
	 
	 Cards cost stamina, as such units have to be able to pay the cost of the card. 
	 
	 Can move as part of activation or must use a move card?
	 
	 How would reaction cards be handled? Have a reaction keyword? What would it do.
	
	- PRO: Cam be very tactical.
	- CON:
		- Will favour high stamina units and/or elite units.
		- Reaction Cards would require additional rules taking it away from the simple game plan. Unless CP is isn't discarded at the end of the turn.


5. **Cards fill units stamina**
	 Keep stamina low, for both units and cards.
	 
	 Units don't spend stamina, instead cards fill units stamina. 
	 
	 Can go over a units stamina, but has some cost to do so. HP or some such. Can only do so with once each turn with a unit or with units that has a special Keyword. 
	 
	 Move is a one stamina cost that all units can do. But only once.
	
	- PRO: 
	- CON: Draw effects would be very powerful if there's no CP or other limiter to how many units one can activate.
