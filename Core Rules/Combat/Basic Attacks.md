All units can do what is called Basic Attacks. These attacks are done by selecting any Action Card and discard it after declaring that the unit is going to attack.

If the unit has a [[🏹 Range]] attribute over 0, then the attack can be a [[🏹 Range#Ranged Attacks|Ranged Attack]]. Following all the basic rules for [[🏹 Range#Ranged Attacks|Ranged Attack]].

Basic Attacks costs only 1 [[🗲 Stamina]] to play.
