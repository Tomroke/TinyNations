When making a ranged attack, be it magical or not, you must be able to draw a straight line to the unit you wish to attack from the attacking units Hex. This line can go over the edges of other Hexes, but is blocked by terrain and units and must be able to end at the full side of a Hex.

The enemy must also be within the [[🏹 Range|🏹]] of the Unit.
